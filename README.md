   FAQs
1. What is CSV?
A CSV file is information seperated using commas, It’s a way to exchange structured information, like the contents of a spreadsheet. Due to its simplicity, CSV can be used by virtually anyone who examines data in spreadsheets and tables. We offer splitting and conversion of CSV files. This tool allows you to split large CSV files into smaller files based on your specicification.
2. What is JSON?
JSON is an open standard file format for sharing Data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. It is a general data format used with different applications, including web applications. It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. Web Developers use JSON to transmit data from the server to the web browser and from the web browser back to the server.
3. Why do I need to split CSV?
Some systems are limited in terms of the size of data they can process. In this case, it is then necessary to split the CSV/JSON files so that they are processed. In other cases, the limitation is at the level of the sending of the data (although a compressed CSV normally takes up little space, the text being easily compressed).
4. How do I split my CSV files?
To split your CSV file, follow these simple steps:
Sign in to your dashboard (if you don’t have an account, create one and Sign in)
Uplaod the CSV file(s) to our servers for splitting
Download or save your chunked files
5. How do I split my JSON files?
To split your JSON file, follow these simple steps:
Sign in to your dashboard (if you don’t have an account, create one and Sign in)
Uplaod the JSON file(s) to our servers for splitting
Download or save your chunked files
6. Are my files stored on the site?
Every user is given the option to have their chunked files stored on our servers. The storage of chunked files is not automatic and is at the choice of each user. Files not saved will be kept in the drafts on the dashboard for a very limited amount of time.
7. How long are files stored on the site?
Draft files are stored for 24 hour only.
8. Are my stored files secure?

### What are CSV Files?
A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.

They usually have the extension .Csv and look like this

Year,Make,Model,Description,Price

1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00

1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00

1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""","",5000.00

1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL!

air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00

### What are Json Files?
JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. JSON file names use the extension .json.


  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a simple text-based open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.JSON file names use the extension .json.

They usually look like this:
{
   "name":"Jack",

   "age":30,

   "contactNumbers":[

      {

         "type":"Home",

      },

      {

### Chunkeet Website’s Documentation
The name of our Project is “Chunkeet” and it was coined from two English words “Chunk” and “It” based on the project we are working on which is Chunking of CSV and JSON Files. Our Team came up with a name that would pass the message to a user that chunking of files is exactly what we do. 
Now, Chunkeet is a website that helps people chunk their large CSV and JSON Files into smaller bits without having their files altered.

Our Team has added great features on the website to ensure a good User Experience. Some of the Unique features we get to provide to the users are;
1. Splitting of CSV and JSON files.

2. Conversion of CSV to JSON files and vice versa

3. Providing Users a website with great User Interface and User Experience.

4. A save to download later option.

5. Ad free website, many websites that are doing what we are doing hardly provide an ad free website which is always frustrating to the Users.
6. Registered Users get to have his/her own dashboard so as to enjoy other benefits on our websites.

7. We included a dark mode for users that prefers the dark mode to light mode.

### HOW OUR WEBSITES WORKS
We built our website in such a way that users will need to have a registered account with us to be able to chunk their files and enjoy other benefits such as conversion of CSV to JSON and vice versa.
When a User enters our Website they get to see the Landing Page. The Landing Page provides a lot of information to all Users (Authenticated Users and Unauthenticated). Informations such as;
What are CSV and JSON files?
Who uses the files and where these files are used?
How to split CSV and JSON files?
How to convert from One file format to another (CSV to JSON and vice versa).
Users will need to register on our website to be able to view more details on what our website does. When the Users finally register on the website, the users will be provided a dashboard where he/she would be able to carry out the chunking process. The dashboard also provides Users with “Storage”, “Draft”, “Setting” and “LogOut”  options on the side navigation menu.

The User can upload their Large CSV and JSON files from their local devices or drag the file to the section on their dashboard where the file will be uploaded.
After the file has been uploaded, the user will see a “split” action button where users will click to get their files chunked. While splitting the file, the users will get to see a progress bar on the file that is splitting and also get to know how long it is taking for the file to be chunked. 

After chunking their files, the platform gives the users an option to “Download and save files” and “Download and Don’t save”. The “Download and save files” option makes it possible for users to download the files to local drive and come back to our website to get the saved/stored documents. The other option is the “Download and Don’t save”, this option was provided for those users that are chunking confidential CSV and JSON files on our platform and would not want us to have hold of the files.

We use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create our websites. Our client-side code is very modular and can be easily consumed by modern front-end technologies. We also use Django for authentication purposes. Our back-end is built using Python/Django with a PostgreSQL database.
