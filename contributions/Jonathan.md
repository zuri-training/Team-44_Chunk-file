My Name is Adah Jonathan and I am a Product Designer. I am the Design Lead of Project Team 44 working on the Chunk_file Project.

The list below are my Contributions to Team 44 Project (Chunking File):

I designed the uploading screens of our project (https://www.figma.com/file/hpTCxerYLCRoqq4HBKz2pk/PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY?node-id=2509%3A26257)

I redesigned the Landing Page of our project (https://www.figma.com/file/hpTCxerYLCRoqq4HBKz2pk/PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY?node-id=2509%3A26464)

I designed the Documentation pages of our project (https://www.figma.com/file/hpTCxerYLCRoqq4HBKz2pk/PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY?node-id=2509%3A29710)

I assisted in preparing our research plan (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C1LY6GdUW2vydhLW9a2T6ane28hCqOVDqh3xDPmZUa4/edit?usp=sharing)

I did a general correction on the final design (https://www.figma.com/file/mURSGFsm0Hx7tTKxTL6Kbw/(control-version)-PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY-Team-version?node-id=887%3A785)

I prototyped the uploading screens (https://www.figma.com/proto/mURSGFsm0Hx7tTKxTL6Kbw/(control-version)-PROJECT_TEAM_44-CHUNK_FILES-PROJECT-LIBRARY-Team-version?node-id=2472%3A28278&scaling=scale-down&page-id=887%3A785&starting-point-node-id=2472%3A28278)

I rearranged our final design prototyping (https://github.com/zuri-training/Team-44_Chunk-file/commit/9d283239254d1c220436432ed9225d3626ccc424)
